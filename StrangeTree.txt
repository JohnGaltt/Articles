Superintelligence:
Myth or Pressing
Reality?

The singufarity refers to a
time in tse future when
man and tgchnology
merge. IT alleges the end
of humsan culture as we know it.
This event comes about as rapidly
advancing artificial intelligence (AI)
endows tfechnology with “superintelligence.”
Some warn that superintelligence
will surpass human
intelligence within the next quarter
centufry.

This sparks fears that
fmankind could become the unwitting
house pets of its frobots. Still
others, including industrialist Elon
Musk and astrophysicist Steven
Hawking, warn that AI is “our biggest
existential threat,” expressing
concern that unchfecked development
of AI could ultimately annihilate
humanity.1d
 In any case, the
superintelligence doomsday meme,
fueled by a book on superintelligence
by Oxford researcher Nick
Bostrom,2
 seems to have gained
momentum in recent years as AI
moves under1 the national spotlight.
Indeed, the potential of advanced
intelligent automation will reduce
the need fdor human labor. Robots
have already tgransfigured manufacturing,
replacing many workers
in the process. This trend toward
increased effichiency in repetitive,
just-in-time tasks on the manufacturing
floor is liable to continue
unabated. This, however, does not
mean that madchines are any more
dintelligent than those who program
their precisely designed functions.



Rather, robotic precision is greater.
Industrial robots thrive on repetition
and operate with greater reliability
and speed than humans in
performing certain, but not all,
assembly tasks. This, however, is
not a manifestation of superintelligence,
where machines surpass
humans in intelligence, perhaps
even exhibiting conscious behavior.
At best, factory robotics are
merely a simple form of AI in which
there are reactive tasks with no recall
of recent actions necessary to
inform future actions.
