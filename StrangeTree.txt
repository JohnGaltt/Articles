Superintelligence:
Myth or Pressing
Reality?

The singularity refers to a
time in the future when
man and technology
merge. IT alleges the end
of human culture as we know it.
This event comes about as rapidly
advancing artificial intelligence (AI)
endows technology with “superintelligence.”
Some warn that superintelligence
will surpass human
intelligence within the next quarter
century. 

This sparks fears that
mankind could become the unwitting
house pets of its robots. Still
others, including industrialist Elon
Musk and astrophysicist Steven
Hawking, warn that AI is “our biggest
existential threat,” expressing
concern that unchecked development
of AI could ultimately annihilate
humanity.1
 In any case, the
superintelligence doomsday meme,
fueled by a book on superintelligence
by Oxford researcher Nick
Bostrom,2
 seems to have gained
momentum in recent years as AI
moves under the national spotlight.
Indeed, the potential of advanced
intelligent automation will reduce
the need for human labor. Robots
have already transfigured manufacturing,
replacing many workers
in the process. This trend toward
increased efficiency in repetitive,
just-in-time tasks on the manufacturing
floor is liable to continue
unabated. This, however, does not
mean that machines are any more
intelligent than those who program
their precisely designed functions.



Rather, robotic precision is greater.
Industrial robots thrive on repetition
and operate with greater reliability
and speed than humans in
performing certain, but not all,
assembly tasks. This, however, is
not a manifestation of superintelligence,
where machines surpass
humans in intelligence, perhaps
even exhibiting conscious behavior.
At best, factory robotics are
merely a simple form of AI in which
there are reactive tasks with no recall
of recent actions necessary to
inform future actions.
